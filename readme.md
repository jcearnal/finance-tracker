# Personal Finance Tracker

A React Native app for tracking your income and expenses on the go. Users can sign up, log in, add/edit/delete transactions, view monthly summaries, visualize spending trends, manage custom categories, and search/filter past transactions. All data is persisted securely in Firebase Firestore under each authenticated user's account.

## Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Email/password sign-up and log-in via Firebase Auth, with persistent sessions across restarts.

- **Add/Edit/Delete Transactions**  
  Record amounts, descriptions, categories, dates, and type (income/expense). Edit or remove entries at any time.

- **Custom Categories**  
  Manage your own categories (add, rename, delete) in Firestore under `users/{uid}/categories`, used throughout the app.

- **Monthly Summary**  
  Calculates opening balance (carry-over), current month's income, expense, and closing balance automatically.

- **Charts & Data Visualization**  
  - Pie chart for this month's income vs. expense distribution  
  - Line chart for income and expense trends over the last 6 months  
  - Bar chart for running balance trend over the last 6 months

- **Transaction List & Month Filter**  
  Browse all transactions in a sortable list, filterable by month via a dropdown.

- **Search & Filter**  
  Find past transactions by description, category, or amount in real time.

- **Protected Routes & Logout**  
  Secure screens behind auth state; logout clears session and returns to the login screen.

## Technologies Used

- **Firebase Authentication** for secure email/password auth  
- **Firebase Firestore** for real-time, user-isolated data storage  
- **react-native-chart-kit** for charts  
- **@react-native-picker/picker** for dropdowns  
- **@react-native-community/datetimepicker** for date selection

## Project Dependencies

```bash
expo
react
react-native
@react-navigation/native
@react-navigation/native-stack
firebase
react-native-chart-kit
@react-native-picker/picker
@react-native-community/datetimepicker

## Authentication

Users must sign up with a valid email and password, then log in to access the main app. Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener ensures auth state is tracked and routes are protected. Logging out via the "Logout" button clears the session.

3. Configure Firebase
